# Orbit Observability

`orbit-observability` coordinates bounded flush and shutdown for explicitly selected logs,
metrics, and tracing providers. Provider-neutral logging, metrics, and tracing APIs and their vendor
adapters remain in their owning packages; this package composes their lifecycle without importing
those packages or any vendor SDK.

**Status:** unpublished v0.1.0-alpha review candidate; lifecycle capability. It does not install instrumentation, collect telemetry,
select exporters, or configure a backend. Core and applications still decide which provider adapters
to install and wire.

Signal packages remain separately installable: `orbit-tracing` exports spans,
`orbit-logging-opentelemetry` exports structured logs, and `orbit-metrics-opentelemetry` exports
Core snapshots and trace exemplars. `orbit-secrets` and its provider adapters resolve versioned
secret values independently of telemetry. The [coverage audit](docs/architecture/secrets-telemetry-audit.md)
separates implemented workspace behavior from provider and release validation still outstanding.
See the [cloud native example](examples/README.md) for secret handling and signal correlation.

## Install

```bash
pip install orbit-observability
```

## Provider lifecycle contract

Providers implement `TelemetryProvider`, declare one or more signals, and own their exporter
resources. The application transfers ownership explicitly to `ObservabilityLifecycle`:

```python
from orbit_observability import ObservabilityLifecycle, TelemetrySignal


class AppTelemetryProvider:
    name = "otlp"
    signals = frozenset({TelemetrySignal.METRICS, TelemetrySignal.TRACES})

    async def force_flush(self, *, timeout_seconds: float) -> None:
        await self.exporter.force_flush(timeout_seconds=timeout_seconds)

    async def shutdown(self, *, timeout_seconds: float) -> None:
        await self.exporter.shutdown(timeout_seconds=timeout_seconds)


lifecycle = ObservabilityLifecycle([AppTelemetryProvider()], max_concurrency=4)
```

Call `force_flush()` at an application-defined checkpoint and `shutdown()` during application
shutdown. Both operations are async, attempt every configured provider, limit concurrent operations,
and enforce a per-provider timeout greater than 0 and at most 300 seconds. Cancellation
propagates to active flushes. Shutdown is one-shot, continues in a retained task if its caller is
cancelled, and can be awaited again. Providers must make their own shutdown idempotent and release
all owned workers, queues, clients, and transports.

Failures are aggregated as stable provider slugs plus `timeout` or `provider_failure`; raw vendor
exceptions are deliberately omitted because they may contain credentials, telemetry values, or
request details. Providers must still apply their own data-minimization and sensitive-attribute
policy before export. This package does not make arbitrary telemetry safe to collect or transmit.

The provider lifecycle is independent of Core's plugin lifecycle. Application integration code
must arrange ownership and call shutdown in the correct order relative to its own event loop and
other resources. No global SDK provider is installed or mutated.
